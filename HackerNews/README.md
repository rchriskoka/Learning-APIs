## Hacker News API Exploration
The goal of this project is to look at making API calls on [Hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com/). On Hacker News, people share articles about programming and technology and also engage
in lively discussions about those articles. In this project, we take a look at retrieving some of the articles/submissions by Hacker News and take a look at some few things about them.

### A Look At The Expected Output After Making The API Call
![Hacker News Top Submissions Output](https://github.com/rchriskoka/Learning-APIs/blob/main/HackerNews/TopNewsBy_HackerNews.png) 

Submissions on Hacker News are ranked according to an overall score, based on a number of factors. We print out three pieces of information about each of the top submissions: 
the title, a link to the discussion page, and the number of comments the submission currently has.

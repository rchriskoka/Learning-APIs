# Learning-APIs
This repository is the beginning of my journey with APIs. 

## What is an API? 
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is basically how different machines and software talk to each other to create ever more complex applications.

## Why build APIs?
These days, very few applications are stand alone. An API can act as a platform for new partnership opportunities, new revenue channels, or even new features for your organization. Many call this the API economy.

## Different Types of APIs
RESTful APIs over HTTP with JSOn is the most popular type of APIs. There's GraphQL but in this repo, just RESTful APIs :)

## What makes Good APIs?
* Easy to learn 
* Easy to use
* Easy to extend
* Easy to read and maintain code that uses it.

### Exploring API Basics With Open Notify
- In this project, we work with [open notify APIs](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) which give access to data about the international space station. 
- We look at making requests to an endpoint to know who is currently at space.
- We also look at using the ``` dumps function ``` to print a formatted string which makes it easier to understand the JSON output.
